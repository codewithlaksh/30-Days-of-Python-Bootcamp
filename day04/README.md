- Oprators:
    1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, **, %, //
    2. Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, =**, %=, //=, >>=, <<=
    3. Bitwise operators: &, |, ~, ^, >>, <<
    4. Comaprison operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    5. Logical operators: and, or, not
    6. Membership operators: in, not in
    7. Identity operators: is, is not

- Arithmetic Operators: These operators perform basic mathematical operations.
- Assignment Operators: These operators assign values to variables.
- Bitwise Operators: These operators work on bits (binary values) of two integers.
- Comparison Operators: These operators compare the values of two variables & return True or False.
- Logical Operators: These operators deal with logical oprations.
- Membership Operators: These operators check the existence of a value in an iterable.
- Identity Operators: These operators return True if all the values are equal & False otherwise.
