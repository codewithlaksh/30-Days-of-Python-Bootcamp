# Day 6: Loops in Python

## Syntax of for loop
```python
for identifier in range(start=0, stop, step=1):
    pass
```

## Syntax of while loop
```python
while (condition):
    pass
```

## Control Statements:
- `pass`: Used when we are not sure, about what we need to do inside a loop (also function).
If we do not use this statement, it will result `IndentationError`, if we leave the for loop or while loop body empty.

- `break`: Abnormally terminates the loop, when a specific condition is reached. 
- `continue`: Skips the iteration of the loop, when a specific condition is reached. 

**Note**: Control statements like `break` and `continue` can be only used within loops.
