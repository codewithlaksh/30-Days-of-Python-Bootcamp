- Variables are the identifiers, which can contain values of specific datatypes.

- Rules for declaring variables:
    1. Variables cannot start with a number. Ex: 99w is invalid
    2. Do not use reserved keywords or functions as variable names. Ex: class, sum
    3. Variables are case sensitive. Ex: a & A are different in python
    4. Variables cannot contain special characters other than underscores (_).
    5. Variables can contain numbers between them.

- Datatypes: int, float, bool, str, list, tuple, dict, set, complex
    1. Mutable datatypes (allow item assignment): list, dict, set
    2. Immutable datatypes (do not allow item assignment): int, float, bool, str, tuple, complex

- Typecasting: Typecasting is the conversion of one datatype to another datatype
