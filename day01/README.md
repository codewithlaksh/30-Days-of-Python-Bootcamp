In this video, we will have a brief introduction about **Python** programming language & install python along with visual studio code in this video itself.

## About Python
Python is an interpreted programming language, which means that the code we write is excuted line by line, not like C/C++, Java, where the whole code is executed at once.

Python had its first public release on 20 February 1991; 34 years ago. Intially, it was developed by **Sir Guido van Rossum**, while he was watching his favourite circus shor **Monty Python**.

Python has a huge community. It has support for gui development, game development, web development, data science, machine learning, deep learning & many more.
